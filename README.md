Smart Pot for Plant Monitoring and Automation
This project is a smart IoT-enabled pot designed to monitor and maintain optimal conditions for plant growth. Using the ESP8266 module, the smart pot tracks essential parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, light levels, and air quality to ensure plants are well-cared for with minimal manual intervention. Actuators are integrated to automate watering and light adjustments, making this a convenient and affordable solution for plant enthusiasts.

The system is prototyped with the Blynk app for real-time monitoring and control, allowing users to receive updates and alerts on mobile devices. The goal is to create an affordable, scalable product, with a targeted cost of under 1000 rupees per pot.

Features:

Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, light levels, and air quality
Automated watering control based on sensor data
Mobile notifications and control via the Blynk app
Modular design for potential future customization
Technologies Used:

Hardware: ESP8266, Soil Moisture Sensor, Temperature/Humidity Sensor, LDR (Light Sensor), MLT Air Quality Sensor
Software: Blynk IoT Platform, Arduino IDE (for programming the ESP8266)
This repository contains the code, hardware schematics, and documentation for the final-year Information Science Engineering capstone project.
